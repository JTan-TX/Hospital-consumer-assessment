### Understand the data
- Field information is consistent or not, for example telephone number, measurement_id vs question
- What's answer percentage and what's survey response rate percentage, and how are they calculated?

### What we want to get from the data?
- In a specific zip code, what's the list of hospitals ordered by rating from high to low

### Observations on hcahps_data
- data is clean, facility basic information is all consistent
- questions are organized well
